##[Mobile app](https://github.com/kristophercowley/IonicCustomShop) for t-shirt design that works with this [Twisted Threadz Custom Shop Demo](http://kristophercowley.github.io/Custom-Shop-Manager/#/home)  to process the orders through Firebase.
Once the orders are filled, they can be marked as such and archived. I am also implementing a chart to visualize sales data.
I am currently building a server in NodeJS to host this application and expect to have the demo up and running soonish.  
This application is built on HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, Material-Design, Javascript, jQuery, AngularJS, FireBaseDB, and AngularFire.   This project is still in the build phase.
