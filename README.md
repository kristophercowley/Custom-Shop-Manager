# Custom-Shop-Manager
This is the business side application to track and manage orders from the [Twisted Threadz](https://github.com/kristophercowley/IonicCustomShop) mobile t-shirt mobile app.  
I am currently building a server in NodeJS to host this application and expect to have the demo up and running within a couple of weeks.  
This application is built on HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, Material-Design, Javascript, jQuery, AngularJS, FireBaseDB, and AngularFire.   This project is still in the build phase
